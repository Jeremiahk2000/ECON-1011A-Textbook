\chapter{Consumer Utility}
So far, we have dealt primarily with firms and how they decide what to produce. Now, we address the other side of the market: consumers and how they decide what to buy and consume. However, we need to find a way to convert this to a maximization problem. With firms, we made the very reasonable assumption that they would try to maximize profits. However, with individuals it is less clear what they would be maximizing. In economics, we assume that individuals are maximizing a \vocab{utility function}, which, in a somewhat tautological definition, is simply whatever an individual maximizes when they are making choices.
